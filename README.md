## üßë‚Äçüíª LOCAL INSTALLATION & SETUP
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to set up the `.env` file.  
> .env file must contain **MONGODB_URL**, **JWT_SECRET** and **PORT**  
> Kindly note : If you want to run on your own backend, then you will have to change the api calls in frontend to your custom api
```bash
cd backend        # Move to backend folder
npm install       # Install required dependencies
node index.js     # Start backend server on specified PORT in .env file (https://localhost:PORT)
 
cd ..             # Move back to root folder
cd frontend       # Move to frontend folder
npm install       # Install required dependencies
npm run dev       # Start frontend on port 5173 (https://localhost:5173)
```


## üìù DESCRIPTION
- You can signup and then signin
- Your password will be stored in database after encrypting through Argon2 password hashing tool
- After signing in, you can see all the users who have already signed up on the platform
- You can also search for any specific user on the platform
- You can click send money and it will redirect you to another page
- In send money page, you can send money to the user by entering any valid number(it should be less than or equal to your current balance)
- On dashboard page, you can also logout manually by hovering over top right corner of your profile and then clicking logout


## üîÆ FUTURE SCOPES
- Removing the name of user itself in dashboard
- Actually using JWT for keeping user's session logged in
- Removing prop-drilling(due to which if page reloads, error is shown) and using state management tools
